A simple class library for interfacing to MMIO peripherals.

Loosely based on the register access methods and MCAL shown in "Real Time C++" by Christopher Kormanyos. 
(https://www.amazon.com/Real-Time-Efficient-Object-Oriented-Microcontroller-Programming/dp/3662478099)

There are two parts.

 - Base classes used to implement registers accesses.
 - Generator templates used to define a device and each register/field.

The generators assume an CMSIS-SVD definition of the registers.

As the bulk of the class library is generated, the client code
does not need alot of boilerplate. Access is as simple as the
structure method used by CMSIS device definitions. However, the base
address is a template parameter. This has advantages and
disadvantages.

Advantage:: With optimization code can be reduced to simply load
stores, no base pointer needs to be stored or passed as a parameter.

Disadvantage:: Every higher level class that uses these peripheral
classes will need to be a template class.

#include "CMSDK_CM3.hpp"
#include "DUALTIMER_mmio_dev.hpp"


    DUALTIMER_dev<base_addr::CMSDK_CM3::DUALTIMER> DUALTIMER_i;

    DUALTIMER_i.TIMER1LOAD.write(1);
    auto DUALTIMER_TIMER1LOAD_v = DUALTIMER_i.TIMER1LOAD.read();

TODO:
 - Add some read/write protection.
 - Make use of ARM Cortex-M bit banding region.
 - Make better use of operators.
